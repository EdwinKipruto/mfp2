\description{
#' In case \code{criterion = "pvalue"} the function selection procedure as outlined
in Chapters 4 and 6 of Royston and Sauerbrei (2008) is used. Briefly, the
first step is to test the best FPm function against a null model at level
\code{select} with 2m df. If not significant, the variable is excluded.
Otherwise, the fps are tested in order against the highest fp.
That is, the next step is to test the best FPm versus linear at level \code{alpha}
with 2m - 1 df. If not significant, use a linear model.
Otherwise the next step is to test the best FPm versus the best FP1 at
level \code{alpha} with 2m - 2 df. If not significant, use the best FP1 model.
And so on, until FPm-1, which is tested at level \code{alpha} with 2 df.
If the final test is not significant, use a FPm-1 model, otherwise use FPm.
}
\details{
Note that the "best" FPx model used in each step is given by the model using
a FPx transformation for the variable of interest and having the highest
likelihood of all such models given the current powers for all other
variables, as outlined in Section 4.8 of Royston and Sauerbrei (2008).
These best FPx models are computed in \code{\link[=find_best_fpm_step]{find_best_fpm_step()}}.
