Description: Algorithm to select variables and functional forms through 
  fractional polynomials in regression models (Generalized linear models 
  and Cox). This package also
  implements various extensions of the original algorithm (sigmoid functional 
  forms) and provides estimation and visualisation of non-linear effects. 
  A key reference is the book by Royston and Sauerbrei, 2008. 
  Multivariable Model - Building: A Pragmatic Approach to Regression Analysis 
  based on Fractional Polynomials for Modelling Continuous Variables.
