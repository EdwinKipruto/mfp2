\value{
A list with several components giving the best power found (\code{power_best}) and
performance indices.
}
\description{
Handles the FP1 and the higher order FP cases. For parameter definitions, see
\code{\link[=find_best_fp_step]{find_best_fp_step()}}.
}
\details{
The "best" model is determined by the highest likelihood (or smallest
deviance by our definition as minus twice the log-likelihood). This is also
the case for the use of information criteria, as all models investigated in
this function have the same df, so the penalization term is equal for all
models and only their likelihoods differ.

Note that the estimation of each fp power adds a degree of freedom. Thus,
all fp1s have 2 df (even the "linear" one), all fp2s have 4 df and so on.
