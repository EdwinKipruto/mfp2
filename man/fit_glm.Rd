\title{Function that fits generalized linear models including gaussian. It uses
glm.fit() function and returns loglikelihood and regression coefficients.}
\usage{
fit_glm(x, y, family, weights, offset)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A design matrix of dimension n * (p+1) where 1 is the intercept}

\item{y}{A vector of response variable of length n.}

\item{family}{a family function e.g gaussian().  A character string naming
a family function is not allowed since we are using internal function, glm.fit}

\item{weights}{a numeric vector of 'prior weights' to be used in the fitting process.}

\item{offset}{a numeric vector of of a priori known component to be included
in the linear predictor during fitting. This should be of length equal to the number of cases}
}
\value{
The log likelihood of the fitted model, regression coefficients and the number of parameters
}
