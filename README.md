# `mfp2`

## Overview

`mfp2` implements multivariable fractional polynomial (MFP) models and various
extensions. It allows the selection of variables and functional forms when
modelling the relationship of a data matrix `x` and some outcome `y`. Currently, it
supports generalized linear models and Cox proportional hazards models.
Additionally, it has the ability to model a sigmoid relationship between covariate `x` and an outcome variable `y`
using approximate cumulative distribution (ACD) transformation- a feature that a standard fractional polynomial function cannot achieve. 

## Compatibility with existing software packages

`mfp2` closely emulates the functionality of the `mfp` and `mfpa` package in Stata.

It augments the functionality of the existing `mfp` R
package by:

-   a matrix and a formula interface for input
-   sigmoid transformations via the ACD transformation
-   estimation and plotting of contrasts and partial linear predictors to
    investigate and visualize non-linear effects
-   various optimizations to increase speed and user friendliness
