\title{A function that assign attribute to a continuous variable that undergo fp transformation}
\usage{
fp(
  x,
  df = 4,
  alpha = 0.05,
  select = 0.05,
  shift = NULL,
  scale = NULL,
  center = TRUE,
  acd = FALSE,
  pow = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of continuous variable to be assigned attributes}

\item{df}{a numeric value specifying the degrees of freedom (df) for
predictor x. Default is 4 (FP2)}

\item{alpha}{a numeric value that sets the significance levels for
function selection. The default nominal significance level is 0.05.}

\item{select}{a numeric value that sets the nominal significance levels for
variable selection by backward elimination. The default nominal significance
level is 0.05. Setting the nominal significance level to be 1 forces the into
the model.}

\item{shift}{a numeric value specifying a shifting value for x. Default is
\code{NULL}which lets the program estimate the shifting factor. If shifting is
not required, set \code{shift = 0} to disable it.}

\item{scale}{a numeric value specifying  scaling factors for x. Default
is \code{NULL} which lets the program estimate the scaling factors.
If scaling is not required set \code{scale = 1} to disable it.}

\item{center}{a logical determining whether transformed variable x
should be centered before fitting the final model. The default \code{TRUE}
which implies mean centering, except for binary covariates, where the
covariate is centered using the lower of the two distinct values of the
covariate.}

\item{acd}{logical indicating whether variable x should undergo
the approximate cumulative distribution (ACD) transformation.
It also invokes the function-selection procedure to determine the
best-fitting FP1(p1, p2) model.}

\item{pow}{a distinct vector of powers to be evaluated for covariate x. Default is NULL
and powers = c(-2, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3) will be used.}
}
\value{
a variable with its attributes.
