\item{formula}{a formula object, with the response on the left of a ~ operator,
and the terms on the right. The response must be a survival object if
\code{family=cox} as returned by the Surv function. The \code{Offset} and \code{strata} can be
added either in the formula or as arguments. If both are present in the formula
and as argument, the latter will be ignored.
