\title{Helper to create overview table of fp terms}
\usage{
create_fp_terms(fp_powers, acdx, df, select, alpha, criterion)
}
\value{
Data.frame with overview of all fp terms. Each row represents a variable,
with rownames giving the name of the variable. Variables with acd
transformation are denoted by (A). The data.frame comprises the following
columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{df_initial}: initial degrees of freedom.
\item \code{select}: significance level for backward elimination.
\item \code{alpha}: significance level for fractional polyomial terms.
\item \code{status}: encodes presence in the model as 1, and absence as 0.
\item \code{df_final}: final estimated degrees of freedom.
\item \code{powerN}: one or more columns with the final estimated fp powers (numbered
1 to N).
}

To be used in \code{\link[=fit_mfp]{fit_mfp()}}.
