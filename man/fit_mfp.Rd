\description{
Function to fit a model using the mfpa algorithm
}
\details{
Not exported. To be called from the \code{mfpa()} function. Most parameters
are explained in the documentation of \code{\link[=mfpa]{mfpa()}}.
This function does not check its arguments.

\section{Algorithm}{

\itemize{
\item Step 1: order variables according to \code{xorder}. This step may involve
fitting a regression model to determine order of significance.
\item Step 2: data pre-processing. Setting initial powers for fractional
polynomial terms, checking if acd transformation is required and allowed.
\item Step 3: run mfp algorithm cycles.
