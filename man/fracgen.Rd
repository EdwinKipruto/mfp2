\title{Generates variables containing fractional polynomial powers similar to fracgen
in stata.For example we can generate a new variables for x given the power(s)
e.g., xnew = log(x) when power = 0 and scale = F and center = F}
\usage{
fracgen(x, power = 1, scale = NULL, center = F, shift = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of a predictor variable}

\item{power}{The user-supplied FP power. Default is 1 (linear)}

\item{scale}{scaling factors for x of interest. Must be positive integers.
Default is NULL and scaling factors are automatically estimated by the program.
If No scaling is needed set scale = 1.}

\item{center}{Specification of centering for the independent variables using
the mean i,e f(x)-mean(f(x)) for continuous variables and x - min(x) for binary
variables. Default is no centering.}

\item{shift}{adjustment factors required for shifting x to positive
values. Default is NULL and adjustment factors are estimated automatically
using Royston and Sauerbrei formula iff any x<=0. shift = 0 means no shifting}
}
\value{
Returns a matrix of transformed variable(s).The number of column
depends on the number of powers provided.
