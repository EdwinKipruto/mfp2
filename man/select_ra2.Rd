\value{
A list with several components:
\itemize{
\item \code{acd}: logical indicating if an ACD transformation was applied for \code{xi},
i.e. \code{FALSE} in this case.
\item \code{powers}: (best) fp powers investigated in step, indexing \code{metrics}.
\item \code{power_best}: a numeric vector with the best power found. The returned
best power may be \code{NA}, indicating the variable has been removed from the
model.
\item \code{metrics}: a matrix with performance indices for all models investigated.
Same number of rows as, and indexed by, \code{powers}.
\item \code{model_best}: row index of best model in \code{metrics}.
\item \code{pvalue}: p-value for comparison of linear and null model.
\item \code{statistic}: test statistic used, depends on \code{ftest}.
}
}
\description{
Used in \code{\link[=find_best_fp_step]{find_best_fp_step()}} when \code{criterion = "pvalue"}.
For parameter explanations, see \code{\link[=find_best_fp_step]{find_best_fp_step()}}. All parameters
captured by \code{...} are passed on to \code{\link[=fit_model]{fit_model()}}.
}
\details{
In case \code{criterion = "pvalue"} the function selection procedure as outlined
in Chapters 4 and 6 of Royston and Sauerbrei (2008) is used.
\itemize{
\item \emph{Step 1}: test the best FPm function against a null model at level
\code{select} with 2m df. If not significant, the variable is excluded.
Otherwise continue with step 2.
\item \emph{Step 2}: test the best FPm versus a linear model at level \code{alpha}
with 2m - 1 df. If not significant, use a linear model.
Otherwise continue with step 3.
\item \emph{Step 3}: test the best FPm versus the best FP1 at
level \code{alpha} with 2m - 2 df. If not significant, use the best FP1 model.
Otherwise, repeat this step for all remaining higher order FPs until
FPm-1, which is tested at level \code{alpha} with 2 df against FPm.
If the final test is not significant, use a FPm-1 model, otherwise use FPm.
}

Note that the "best" FPx model used in each step is given by the model using
a FPx transformation for the variable of interest and having the highest
likelihood of all such models given the current powers for all other
variables, as outlined in Section 4.8 of Royston and Sauerbrei (2008).
These best FPx models are computed in \code{\link[=find_best_fpm_step]{find_best_fpm_step()}}.
