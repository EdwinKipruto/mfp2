\title{A function that is used to shift x values to positive values if it contains
negative or zero values.If all values of x are positive then the original
values of x is returned without shifting.
if x has already been shifted and scaled then the function does nothing}
\usage{
shift.scale(x, scale, shift)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A vector of predictor variable}

\item{scale}{scaling factors for x of interest. Must be positive integers.
Default is NULL and  scaling factors are automatically estimated using 
scalefn() function else it uses user suppled scaling factors. If no scaling 
is needed just use scale = 1 because x/1 = x}

\item{shift}{adjustment factors required for shifting x to positive 
values. Default is NULL and adjustment factors are estimated automatically 
using Royston and Sauerbrei formula.}
