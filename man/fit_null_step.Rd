\arguments{
\item{x}{an input matrix of dimensions nobs x nvars. Does not contain
intercept, but columns are already expanded into dummy variables as
necessary. Data are assumed to be shifted and scaled.}

\item{xi}{a character string indicating the name of the current variable
of interest, for which the best fractional polynomial transformation is
to be estimated in the current step.}

\item{y}{a vector for the response variable or a \code{Surv} object.}

\item{powers_current}{a list of length equal to the number of variables,
indicating the fp powers to be used in the current step for all variables
(except \code{xi}).}

\item{powers}{a named list of numeric values that sets the permitted FP
powers for each covariate.}

\item{acdx}{a logical vector of length nvars indicating continuous variables
to undergo the approximate cumulative distribution (ACD) transformation.}

\item{family}{a character string representing a family object.}

\item{zero}{A named logical vector indicating, which columns of
\code{x} should treat nonpositive values (zero or negative) as zero before
transformation. Must be the same length as the columns of \code{x}.}

\item{catzero}{A named list of binary indicator variables of length \code{ncol(x)}
for nonpositive values, created when specific variables are passed to the
\code{catzero} argument of \code{fit_mfp}. If an element of the list is
\code{NULL}, it indicates that the corresponding variable was not specified by
the user in the \code{catzero} argument of \code{fit_mfp}. Here, \code{catzero}
is a list of binary variables, not a named logical vector as in \code{fit_mfp}.}

\item{spike_decision}{Named vector indicating how spike-at-zero (SAZ)
variables are handled. Each element corresponds to a variable and encodes
the selected strategy: \code{1} = include FP for positive values plus binary SAZ,
\code{2} = treat as continuous FP only, \code{3} = include binary SAZ only.}

\item{acd_parameter}{Named list of ACD parameters produced by \code{\link[=fit_acd]{fit_acd()}},
with length equal to \code{ncol(x)}. Each list element corresponds to a variable;
if an element is \code{NULL}, the variable was not specified in the
\code{acdx} argument of \code{fit_mfp}.}

\item{prev_adj_params}{Named list storing adjustment variable transformations
from previous steps.}

\item{...}{Parameters passed to \code{fit_model()}.}
}
\value{
A list with two entries:
\itemize{
\item \code{powers}: FP power(s) of \code{xi} in fitted model - in this case \code{NA}.
\item \code{metrics}: A matrix with performance indices for fitted model.
}
}
\description{
"Null" model here refers to a model which does not include the variable
of interest \code{xi}.
For parameter definitions, see \code{\link[=find_best_fp_step]{find_best_fp_step()}}. All parameters
captured by \code{...} are passed on to \code{\link[=fit_model]{fit_model()}}.
