\arguments{
\item{x}{an input matrix of dimensions nobs x nvars. Does not contain
intercept, but columns are already expanded into dummy variables as
necessary. Data are assumed to be shifted and scaled.}

\item{y}{a vector for the response variable or a \code{Surv} object.}

\item{xi}{a character string indicating the name of the current variable
of interest, for which the best fractional polynomial transformation is
to be estimated in the current step.}

\item{weights}{a vector of observation weights of length nobs.}

\item{offset}{a vector of length nobs of offsets.}

\item{df}{a numeric vector indicating the maximum degrees of freedom for the
variable of interest \code{xi}.}

\item{powers_current}{a list of length equal to the number of variables,
indicating the fp powers to be used in the current step for all variables
(except \code{xi}).}

\item{family}{a character string representing a family object.}

\item{criterion}{a character string defining the criterion used to select
variables and FP models of different degrees.}

\item{select}{a numeric value indicating the significance level
for backward elimination of \code{xi}.}

\item{alpha}{a numeric value indicating the significance level
for tests between FP models of different degrees for \code{xi}.}

\item{keep}{a character vector with names of variables to be kept
in the model.}

\item{powers}{a named list of numeric values that sets the permitted FP
powers for each covariate.}

\item{method}{a character string specifying the method for tie handling in
Cox regression.}

\item{strata}{a factor of all possible combinations of stratification
variables. Returned from \code{\link[survival:strata]{survival::strata()}}.}

\item{nocenter}{a numeric vector with a list of values for fitting Cox
models. See \code{\link[survival:coxph]{survival::coxph()}} for details.}

\item{acdx}{a logical vector of length nvars indicating continuous variables
to undergo the approximate cumulative distribution (ACD) transformation.}

\item{ftest}{a logical indicating the use of the F-test for Gaussian models.}

\item{control}{a list with parameters for model fit.}

\item{rownames}{a parameter for Cox models.}

\item{zero}{A named logical vector indicating, which columns of
\code{x} should treat nonpositive values (zero or negative) as zero before
transformation. Must be the same length as the columns of \code{x}.}

\item{catzero}{A named list of binary indicator variables of length \code{ncol(x)}
for nonpositive values, created when specific variables are passed to the
\code{catzero} argument of \code{fit_mfp}. If an element of the list is
\code{NULL}, it indicates that the corresponding variable was not specified by
the user in the \code{catzero} argument of \code{fit_mfp}. Here, \code{catzero}
is a list of binary variables, not a named logical vector as in \code{fit_mfp}.}

\item{verbose}{a logical; run in verbose mode.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector indicating the best powers for \code{xi}. Entries can be
\code{NA} if variable is to be removed from the working model. Note that this
vector may include up to two \code{NA} entries when ACD transformation is
requested, but otherwise is either a vector with all numeric entries, or a
single \code{NA}.

\description{
See \code{\link[=mfp2]{mfp2()}} for a brief summary on the notation used here and
\code{\link[=fit_mfp]{fit_mfp()}} for an overview of the fitting procedure.
}
\details{
The function selection procedure (FSP) is used if the p-value criterion is
chosen, whereas the criteria AIC and BIC select the model with the smallest
AIC and BIC, respectively.

It uses transformations for all other variables to assess the FP form of
the current variable of interest. This function covers three main use cases:
\itemize{
\item the linear case (\code{df = 1}) to test between null and linear models (see
\code{\link[=select_linear]{select_linear()}}). This step differs from the mfp case because
linear models only use 1 df, while estimation of (every) fp power adds
another df. This is also the case applied for categorical variables for
which \code{df} are set to 1.
\item the case that an acd transformation is requested (\code{acdx} is \code{TRUE}
for \code{xi}) for the variable of interest (see \code{\link[=find_best_fpm_step]{find_best_fpm_step()}}).
\item the (usual) case of the normal mfp algorithm to assess non-linear
functional forms (see \code{\link[=find_best_fpm_step]{find_best_fpm_step()}}).
}

Note that these cases do not encompass the setting that a variable is not
selected, because the evaluation is done for each variable in each cycle.
A variable which was de-selected in earlier cycles may be added to the
working model again. Also see \code{\link[=find_best_fp_cycle]{find_best_fp_cycle()}}.

The adjustment in each step uses the current fp powers given in
\code{powers_current} for all other variables to determine the adjustment set
and transformations in the  working model.

Note that the algorithm starts by setting all \code{df = 1}, and higher fps
are evaluated in turn starting from the first step in the first cycle.
}
\section{Functional form selection}{

There are 3 criteria to decide for the current best functional form of a
continuous variable.

The first option for \code{criterion = "pvalue"} is the function selection
procedure as outlined in e.g. Chapters 4 and 6 of Royston and
Sauerbrei (2008), also abbreviated as "RA2".
It is a closed testing procedure and is implemented in \code{\link[=select_ra2]{select_ra2()}} and
extended for ACD transformation in \code{\link[=select_ra2_acd]{select_ra2_acd()}} according to
Royston and Sauerbrei (2016).

For the other criteria \code{aic} and \code{bic} all FP models up to the desired degree
are fitted and the model with the lowest value for the information criteria
is chosen as the final one. This is implemented in \code{\link[=select_ic]{select_ic()}}.
