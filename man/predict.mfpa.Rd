\arguments{
\item{object}{a fitted object of class \code{mfpa} which inherit from \code{glm},\code{lm} or \code{coxph}.}

\item{newdata}{optionally, a data frame in which to look for variables with
which to predict. See \code{predict.glm()} or \code{predict.coxph()} for details}

\item{type}{the type of prediction required.  The default is on the
scale of the linear predictors. See \code{predict.glm()} or \code{predict.coxph()} for details}

\item{terms}{to be discussed}

\item{se.fit}{NOT NEEDED, TO DISCUSS WITH MICHAEL}

\item{dispersion}{NOT NEEDED}

\item{na.action}{function determining what should be done with missing values in newdata. The default is to predict NA.}

\item{collapse}{optional vector of subject identifiers. If specified, the output will contain one entry per subject rather than one entry per observation.}

\item{reference}{reference for centering predictions, see details below}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}

\description{
Obtains predictions from an \code{mfpa} object
}
\details{
To prepare the \code{newdata} for prediction, the first step is to apply any
necessary shifting and scaling based on the factors obtained from the training data.
It's important to note that if the shifting factors are not sufficiently large,
variables may end up with negative values, which can cause prediction errors.
The next step involves transforming the data using the selected
fractional polynomial (FP) power. Once the transformation is complete, the
transformed data is passed to either \code{predict.glm()} or \code{predict.coxph()},
depending on the chosen family of models.
