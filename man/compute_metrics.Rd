\title{Compute Model Metrics for Candidate Spike-at-zero Models}
\usage{
compute_metrics(fit1, fit2, fit3, n_obs, power_best)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit1}{Fitted object for Model 1 (complex model from stage 1 of SAZ).}

\item{fit2}{Fitted object for Model 2 (FPm/linear only plus adjusted covariates).}

\item{fit3}{Fitted object for Model 3 (binary-only plus adjusted covariates).}

\item{n_obs}{Number of observations in the dataset.}

\item{power_best}{Numeric vector of selected powers for the best FP terms
from stage 1 of SAZ algorithm.}
}
\value{
A list with three elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{metrics1}: Fit statistics for Model 1.
\item \code{metrics2}: Fit statistics for Model 2.
\item \code{metrics3}: Fit statistics for Model 3.
}
}
\description{
This function computes fit statistics for the three candidate models
used in the spike-at-zero (SAZ) algorithm. Model 1 metrics are extracted
directly from the previously fitted model, while metrics for Model 2
(FPm/linear only) and Model 3 (binary-only) are computed using
\code{calculate_model_metrics}.
}
\details{
The function determines the degree of the fractional polynomial based on \code{power_best}.
Model 1 metrics are retrieved from the best-fit row of the \code{fit1} object.
Metrics for Models 2 and 3 are calculated using \code{calculate_model_metrics}.
