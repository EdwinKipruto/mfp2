\arguments{
\item{x}{an input matrix of dimensions nobs x nvars. Does not contain
intercept, but columns are already expanded into dummy variables as
necessary. Data are assumed to be shifted and scaled.}

\item{xi}{a character string indicating the name of the current variable
of interest, for which the best fractional polynomial transformation is
to be estimated in the current step.}

\item{keep}{a character vector with names of variables to be kept
in the model.}

\item{degree}{integer > 0 giving the degree for the FP transformation.}

\item{acdx}{a logical vector of length nvars indicating continuous variables
to undergo the approximate cumulative distribution (ACD) transformation.}

\item{y}{a vector for the response variable or a \code{Surv} object.}

\item{powers_current}{a list of length equal to the number of variables,
indicating the fp powers to be used in the current step for all variables
(except \code{xi}).}

\item{powers}{a named list of numeric values that sets the permitted FP
powers for each covariate.}

\item{criterion}{a character string defining the criterion used to select
variables and FP models of different degrees.}

\item{ftest}{a logical indicating the use of the F-test for Gaussian models.}

\item{select}{a numeric value indicating the significance level
for backward elimination of \code{xi}.}

\item{alpha}{a numeric value indicating the significance level
for tests between FP models of different degrees for \code{xi}.}

\item{family}{a character string representing a family object.}

\item{zero}{A named logical vector indicating, which columns of
\code{x} should treat nonpositive values (zero or negative) as zero before
transformation. Must be the same length as the columns of \code{x}.}

\item{catzero}{A named list of binary indicator variables of length \code{ncol(x)}
for nonpositive values, created when specific variables are passed to the
\code{catzero} argument of \code{fit_mfp}. If an element of the list is
\code{NULL}, it indicates that the corresponding variable was not specified by
the user in the \code{catzero} argument of \code{fit_mfp}. Here, \code{catzero}
is a list of binary variables, not a named logical vector as in \code{fit_mfp}.}

\item{...}{passed to fitting functions.}
}
\value{
A list with several components:
\itemize{
\item \code{keep}: logical indicating if \code{xi} is forced into model.
\item \code{acd}: logical indicating if an ACD transformation was applied for \code{xi},
i.e. \code{FALSE} in this case.
\item \code{powers}: (best) fp powers investigated in step, indexing \code{metrics}.
Ordering: FP1(x, A(x)), null, linear, FP1(x, .), linear(., A(x)),
FP1(., A(x)).
\item \code{power_best}: a numeric vector with the best power found. The returned
best power may be \code{NA}, indicating the variable has been removed from the
model.
\item \code{metrics}: a matrix with performance indices for all models investigated.
Same number of rows as, and indexed by, \code{powers}.
\item \code{model_best}: row index of best model in \code{metrics}.
\item \code{pvalue}: p-value for comparison of linear and null model.
\item \code{statistic}: test statistic used, depends on \code{ftest}.
}
}
\description{
Used in \code{\link[=find_best_fp_step]{find_best_fp_step()}} when \code{criterion = "pvalue"} and an
ACD transformation is requested for \code{xi}.
For parameter explanations, see \code{\link[=find_best_fp_step]{find_best_fp_step()}}. All parameters
captured by \code{...} are passed on to \code{\link[=fit_model]{fit_model()}}.
}
\details{
This function extends the algorithm used in \code{\link[=select_ra2]{select_ra2()}} to allow the
usage of ACD transformations. The implementation follows the description
in Royston and Sauerbrei (2016). The procedure is outlined in detail in
the corresponding section in the documentation of \code{\link[=mfp2]{mfp2()}}.

When a variable is forced into the model by including it in \code{keep}, then
this function will not exclude it from the model (by setting its power to
\code{NA}), but will only choose its functional form.
