\title{Function that generates a matrix of FP powers for any degree}
\usage{
generate_powers_fp(degree = NULL, powers = NULL)

generate_powers_acd(degree = NULL, powers = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{degree}{The degree of fractional polynomial; degree = 1 is FP1 and
returns 8 powers; degree 2 is FP2 and returns 36 pairs of powers; degree 3 is
FP3 and returns 120 triples of powers etc. If the ACD transformation is used,
this degree is assumed to be 2. #'}

\item{powers}{the set of allowed powers for the fractional polynomials.
Default is \code{NULL} and the set {-2, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3} is used.}
}
\value{
A matrix of powers with degree columns and rows depending on the \code{degree}.
}
\description{
Function that generates a matrix of FP powers for any degree
}
\details{
For FP powers, this function returns all combinations of the powers of
length \code{degree}, that is all pairs in which each entry is taken from the
set \code{powers}, but no pair is repeated (i.e. the order of the entries does
not matter).
Thus, for the default set of powers and degree 2, this function returns
36 combinations.

For ACD powers, this function simply returns all possible tuples of
powers of length n.
Thus, for the default set of powers, this function returns 8 possible
powers, and for degree 2 it returns 64 pairs of powers. Higher degrees
are not supported by the function.
