\title{Fits glm and Cox proportional hazards regression models and returns the
p-values of variables ordered or not ordered as defined in option xorder.}
\usage{
varorder(
  x,
  y,
  weights,
  offset,
  family,
  method,
  strata,
  control,
  rownames,
  nocenter,
  xorder
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A design matrix of dimension n * p+1 where n is the number of
observations and p the number of predictors including intercept for glm but
n*p for cox}

\item{y}{A vector of response variable. For family = "cox", y is a
Surv object from the survival package, generated using Surv() function}

\item{family}{A character string naming a family function}

\item{method}{A character string specifying the method for tie handling in cox}

\item{strata, weights, offset, control, rownames, nocenter}{parameters for glm or cox model. see glm() or coxph()}

\item{xorder}{Determines the order of entry of the covariates into the
model-selection algorithm. The default is "ascending", which enters them in
decreasing order of significance in a multiple linear
regression (most significant first). "descending" places them in reverse
significance order, whereas "original" respects the original order in x}
}
\value{
p-values for each predictor variable
}
