\description{
This function estimates the best FP functions for all predictors in the
current cycle. To be used in \code{\link[=fit_mfp]{fit_mfp()}}.
}
\details{
A cycle is defined as a pass through all of the predictors in the input
matrix \code{x}. A step is defined as the assessment of a single predictor.
This algorithm is described in Sauerbrei et al 2006.
