\title{Print method for objects of class \code{mfp2}}
\usage{
\method{print}{mfp2}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{\code{mfp2} object to be printed.}

\item{...}{passed to \code{print} methods of underlying model class. A useful
option as the \code{digits} argument, indicating printed digits.}
}
\value{
Two dataframes: the first one contains preprocessing parameters (shifting, scaling, and
centering), and the second one includes additional parameters such as \code{df}, \code{select}, and
\code{alpha} passed through \code{mfp2}. It also returns a list of the final model fitted, which can be
either a GLM or Cox model depending on the chosen family.
}
\description{
Enhances printing by information on data processing and fractional
polynomials.
