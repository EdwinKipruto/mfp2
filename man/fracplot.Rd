\arguments{
\item{model}{mfpa model}

\item{x}{variable name to be plotted.}

\item{plotype}{selects which graphics engine to use to generate the
fractional polynomial plot. Either 'ggplot' or 'rplot'. Default is "ggplot"}

\item{partials}{produces component-plus-residual plots of the continuous variables when set to TRUE otherwise
partial predictor would be produced. Default is TRUE}

\item{col.points}{The color of the data points when component-plus-residual plot is generated}

\item{title}{The title of the plot}

\item{col.line}{The color of the partial predictor line}

\item{size, cex}{line width of the partial predictor and the size of the points
when component-plus-residual plot is generated}

\item{ylab, xlab, pch}{other graphical parameters}

\item{fill}{the color for confidence interval}

\item{alpha}{refers to the opacity of the confidence interval.
Values of alpha range from 0 to 1, with lower values corresponding to more
transparent colors. See ggplot2
\subsection{Details on \code{plotype} option}{

Selects which graphics engine to use to generate the
fractional polynomial plot. Either 'ggplot' or 'rplot'. Default is "ggplot"

For Cox models, the response should preferably be a \code{Surv} object,
created by the \code{Surv()} function in \pkg{survival} package and the \code{family = cox}. Only
right-censored data are currently supported. To fit stratified Cox
models, strata option can be used.

\description{
plots the data and fit, with 95\% confidence limits, from the fractional
polynomial (FP) model. The data and fit are plotted against the selected covariate of
interest.
