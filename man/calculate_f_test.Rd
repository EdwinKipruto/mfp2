\title{Function to compute F-statistic and p-value from deviances}
\usage{
calculate_f_test(deviances, dfs, n_obs)
}
\arguments{
\item{deviances}{a numeric vector of length 2 with deviances. Typically
ordered in increasing order (i.e. null model first, then full model) and
used to test the difference \code{deviances[1] - deviances[2]}.}

\item{dfs}{a numeric vector with degrees of freedom.}

\item{n_obs}{a numeric value with the number of observations.}
}
\value{
The p-value for the F-test for the comparison of \code{deviance[1]} to
\code{deviance[2]}.
}
\description{
Alternative to likelihood ratio tests in normal / Gaussian error models.
}
\details{
Uses formula on page 23 from here: https://www.stata.com/manuals/rfp.pdf:
\deqn{F = \frac{d_2}{d_1} (exp(\frac{D_2 - D_1}{n}) - 1),}
where \eqn{D} refers to deviances of two models 1 and 2.
\eqn{d1} is the number of additional parameters used in in model 2 as
compared to model 1.
\eqn{d2} is the number of residual degrees of freedom minus the number of
estimated powers, i.e. \code{dfs[2]}.
#' The p-value then results from the use of a F-distribution with
(\code{dfs[1]}, \code{dfs[2]}) degrees of freedom.

Note that this computation is completely equivalent to the computation
of a F-test using sum of squared errors as in e.g. Kutner at al. (2004),
p 263. The formula there is given as
\deqn{F = \frac{SSE(R) - SSE(F)}{df_R - df_F} / \frac{SSE(F)}{df_F},}
where the \eqn{df} terms refer to residual degrees of freedom, and \eqn{R}
and \eqn{F} to the reduced (model 1) and full model (model 2), respectively.
