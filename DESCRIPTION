Description: Multivariable fractional polynomial algorithm simultaneously selects variables and functional forms in both generalized linear models and Cox proportional hazard models. Key references are Royston and Altman (1994) <doi:10.2307/2986270> and Royston and Sauerbrei (2008, ISBN:978-0-470-02842-1). In addition, the implementation can model semi-continuous covariates with a “spike at zero” using a two-stage selection procedure. This extension follows the framework proposed by Becher et al. (2012) <doi:10.1002/bimj.201100263>. The package also includes the approximate cumulative distribution (ACD) transformation to model a sigmoid relationship between variable x and an outcome variable y, as described in Royston (2014) <doi:10.1177/1536867X1401400206> and Royston and Sauerbrei (2016) <doi: 10.1177/1536867X1601600>. This feature distinguishes it from a standard fractional polynomial function, which lacks the ability to achieve such modeling.
