\usage{
find_best_linear_step(
  x,
  xi,
  y,
  powers_current,
  criterion,
  select,
  alpha,

}
\value{
A list with several components giving the best power found (\code{power_best}) and
performance indices. The returned best power may be \code{NA}, indicating the
variable has been removed from the model.
}
\description{
To be used in \code{\link[=find_best_fp_step]{find_best_fp_step()}}. Only used if \code{df = 1} for a variable.
For parameter explanations, see \code{\link[=find_best_fp_step]{find_best_fp_step()}}. All parameters
captured by \code{...} are passed on to \code{\link[=fit_model]{fit_model()}}.
}
\details{
This function assesses a single variable of interest \code{xi} regarding its
functional form in the current working model as indicated by
\code{powers_current}, with the choice between a excluding \code{xi} ("null model") and
including a linear term ("linear fp") for \code{xi}.
