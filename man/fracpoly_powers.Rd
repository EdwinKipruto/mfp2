\title{Function that generates a matrix of FP powers for any degree}
\usage{
fracpoly_powers(degree = NULL, powers = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{degree}{The degree of fractional polynomial; degree = 1 is FP1 and
returns 8 powers; degree 2 is FP2 and returns 36 pairs of powers; degree 3 is
 FP3 and returns 120 triple of powers etc.}

\item{powers}{the set of fractional polynomial. Default is NULL in which the set
s = {-2, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3} is used}
}
\value{
A matrix of powers depending on the degree
}
\description{
Function that generates a matrix of FP powers for any degree
