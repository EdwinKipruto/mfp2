\title{Verbose printing of the function selection procedure (FSP)}
\usage{
print_mfp_step(xi, criterion, fit, stage2 = FALSE)

print_mfp_pvalue_step(xi, fit, criterion, spike = FALSE)

print_mfp_ic_step(xi, fit, criterion, spike = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{xi}{Character string. The name of the covariate currently being tested.}

\item{criterion}{Character string. The selection criterion, either \code{"pvalue"}
or \code{"aic"}/\code{"bic"} (depending on implementation in
\code{print_mfp_ic_step()}).}

\item{fit}{A list containing the intermediate fit for the current variable.
Typically produced by \code{mfp_step}.}

\item{stage2}{Logical. When \code{FALSE} (default), only Stage 1 results of the
spike-at-zero (SAZ) procedure are printed, or the usual FSP output for
\code{xi} when \code{fit$spike[xi] = FALSE}. When \code{TRUE}, Stage 1 results are printed,
and if \code{fit$spike[xi] = TRUE} and the Stage 1 selected model is not \code{"null"},
the Stage 2 spike-at-zero results are printed immediately after Stage 1.}

\item{spike}{Logical. Indicates whether \code{xi} was treated as a spike-at-zero
variable. Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\description{
This function prints intermediate results from the fractional polynomial
function selection process, including details of the spike-at-zero algorithm
when relevant. It is primarily called from within \code{mfp_step} during model
selection.
}
\details{
Printing is split into two parts:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Stage 1}: All candidate FP/ACD models for \code{xi} are listed with their powers,
degrees of freedom, and criterion-specific statistics. If \code{fit$spike[xi] = TRUE},
this corresponds to the first stage of the spike-at-zero (SAZ) algorithm.
\item \strong{Stage 2}: If \code{stage2 = TRUE} and the Stage 1 selected model for \code{xi} is
not \code{"null"}, the results of the spike-at-zero are printed immediately
after Stage 1. The chosen model is highlighted at the end of the table.
