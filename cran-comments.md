* This update adds support for modeling semicontinuous covariates with the spike-at-zero algorithm, 
introduces `zero` and `catzero` options in `mfp2()`, extends the `family` argument to accept GLM family 
functions and link specifications, fixes a bug in `predict.mfp2()` for `type = "response"` in the binomial family, 
improves efficiency in `transform_data_step()`, and updates `fracplot()` to allow plotting variables with a spike at zero.
