\usage{
fit_weibull(
  x,
  y,
  weights,
  offset,
  control = NULL,
  robust = FALSE,
  cluster,
  scalew = 0,
  strata = NULL,
  fast = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a matrix of predictors excluding intercept with nobs observations.}

\item{y}{a \code{Surv} object.}

\item{weights}{a numeric vector of length nobs of 'prior weights' to be used
in the fitting process.}

\item{offset}{a numeric vector of length nobs of of a priori known component
to be included in the linear predictor during fitting.}

\item{strata, control}{passed to \code{\link[survival:survival-internal]{survival::survreg.fit()}}.}

\item{fast}{a logical which determines how the model is fitted. The default
\code{TRUE} uses fast fitting routines (i.e. \code{\link[survival:survival-internal]{survival::survreg.fit()}}), while
\code{FALSE}uses the normal fitting routines (\code{\link[survival:survreg]{survival::survreg()}}) (used for
the final output of \code{mfp2}).}
}
\value{
A list with the following components:
\itemize{
\item \code{logl}: the log likelihood of the fitted model.
\item \code{coefficients}: regression coefficients.
\item \code{df}: number of parameters (degrees of freedom).
\item \code{sse}: residual sum of squares (not used).
\item \code{fit}: the fitted model object.
