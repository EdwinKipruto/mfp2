\arguments{
\item{y}{the response variable.}

\item{x}{The original untransformed matrix of predictors. Each continuous
predictor is assumed to have  shifted and scaled.}

\item{xi}{the name of the continuous predictor for which the FP function will
be estimated. There are no binary or two-level variables allowed.}

\item{allpowers}{a named list of FP powers of all variables of interest,
including xi. Not that these powers are updated during backfitting or MFP
cycles.}

\item{powers}{a set of FP powers.}

\item{family}{A character name specifying the family name i,e "gaussian",
"binomial", "poisson" or "cox".}

\item{method}{method for handling ties in cox model. see coxph() for
explanation.}

\item{weights}{see glm or coxph for explanation.}

\item{offset}{see glm or coxph for explanation.}
