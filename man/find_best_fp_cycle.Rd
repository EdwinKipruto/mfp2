\description{
This function estimates the best FP functions for all predictors in the
current cycle. To be used in \code{\link[=fit_mfp]{fit_mfp()}}.
}
\details{
A cycle is defined as a pass through all of the predictors in the input
matrix \code{x}. A step is defined as the assessment of a single predictor.
This algorithm is described in Sauerbrei et al 2006.

Briefly, a cycle works as follows. It has as input the data matrix and a set
of current fp powers for each variable. Some of the variables may have their
fp power set to \code{NA}, which means they were deselected from the model.
In each step, the fp powers of a single covariate are assessed.
To do this, all of the other variables are transformed as defined by the
current powers (this is done in \code{\link[=extract_adjustment_data]{extract_adjustment_data()}}) and the
fp powers of the variable of interest are tested using the closed test
procedure (done in \code{\link[=find_best_fp_step]{find_best_fp_step()}}). The results from each step are
collected and returned, completing a cycle.
