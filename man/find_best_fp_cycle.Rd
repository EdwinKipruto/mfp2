\description{
This function estimates the best FP functions for all predictors in the
current cycle. To be used in \code{\link[=fit_mfp]{fit_mfp()}}.
}
\details{
A cycle is defined as a pass through all of the predictors in the input
matrix \code{x}. A step is defined as the assessment of a single predictor.
This algorithm is described in Sauerbrei et al 2006.

Briefly, a cycle works as follows. It has as input the data matrix and a set
of current fp powers for each variable. In each step, the fp powers of a
single covariate are assessed.
To do this, all of the other variables are transformed as defined by the
current powers (this is done in \code{\link[=transform_data_step]{transform_data_step()}}) and the
fp powers of the variable of interest are tested using the closed test
procedure (done in \code{\link[=find_best_fp_step]{find_best_fp_step()}}). Some of the variables may have
their fp power set to \code{NA}, which means they were deselected from the model
and are not used in that step as adjustment variables.
The results from each step are collected and returned, completing a cycle.

Note that each cycle goes through all variables. In particular that means
even if a variable was eliminated in an earlier cycle, it will re-enter
each new cycle at the beginning to be kept or eliminated again. Elimination
only affects the current cycle, that is once a variable is eliminated it
will not be used as adjustment variable (see \code{\link[=transform_data_step]{transform_data_step()}})
for the remaining variables of the cycle. All other transformations are kept
as in earlier cycles. See e.g. Sauerbrei and Royston (1999) for details.
