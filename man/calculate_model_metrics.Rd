\title{Function to compute model metrics to be used within \code{mfpa}}
\usage{
calculate_model_metrics(obj, n_obs)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{a list returned by \code{\link[=fit_model]{fit_model()}} representing a glm or Cox model
fit.}

\item{n_obs}{a numeric value indicating the number of observations for the
data used to fit \code{obj}.}
}
\value{
A list with the following entries:
\itemize{
\item \code{df}: number of degrees of freedom of model (i.e. coefficients).
\item \code{deviance_rs}: "deviance", i.e. minus twice the log likelihood. This is not
usual definition of deviance used by R, which is defined as twice the
difference between the log likelihoods of the saturated model (one parameter
per observation) and the null (or reduced) model. It is, however, the
definition used in Royston and Sauerbrei (2008) and in \code{mfp}. For selection
of fps this does not really play a role, as the common factor would be
cancelled anyway when comparing models based on deviances.
\item \code{sse}: sum of squared residuals as returned by \code{\link[=fit_model]{fit_model()}}.
\item \code{deviance_stata}: deviance computed by \code{\link[=deviance_stata]{deviance_stata()}}.
\item \code{aic}: Akaike information criterion, defined as \verb{-2logL + 2df}.
\item \code{bic}: Bayesian information criterion, defined as \verb{-2logL + log(n_obs)df}.
\item \code{df_resid}: residual degrees of freedom. For consistency with stata we
subtract the scale parameter.

\description{
Mostly used within an mfp step to compare between the different fp models
of a variable.
