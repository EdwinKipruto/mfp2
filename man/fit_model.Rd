\title{A function that fits generalized linear models and cox proportional hazard
models. It uses glm.fit() and coxph.fit() function in stats and survival package}
\usage{
fit_model(
  x,
  y,
  family,
  weights,
  offset,
  method,
  strata,
  control,
  rownames,
  nocenter
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{matrix of predictors including column of 1s for intercept except for cox}

\item{y}{a vector of outcome variable in glm but a matrix of survival object in cox}

\item{family}{a character names specifying glm family in addition to cox as a family}

\item{method}{a character string specifying the method for tie handling. See coxph()}

\item{strata, control, weights, offset, rownames, nocenter}{parameters for cox model. see coxph()}
