\arguments{
\item{x}{an input matrix of dimensions nobs x nvars. Does not contain
intercept, but columns are already expanded into dummy variables as
necessary. Data are assumed to be shifted and scaled.}

\item{xi}{a character string indicating the name of the current variable
of interest, for which the best fractional polynomial transformation is
to be estimated in the current step.}

\item{y}{a vector for the response variable or a \code{Surv} object.}

\item{powers_current}{a list of length equal to the number of variables,
indicating the fp powers to be used in the current step for all variables
(except \code{xi}).}

\item{powers}{a named list of numeric values that sets the permitted FP
powers for each covariate.}

\item{acdx}{a logical vector of length nvars indicating continuous variables
to undergo the approximate cumulative distribution (ACD) transformation.}

\item{family}{Either a character string naming the family (e.g., "gaussian", "binomial", "cox")
or a function that returns a GLM family object (e.g., stats::gaussian).
For Cox models, only a character string "cox" is allowed.}

\item{family_string}{A character string representing the selected family,
e.g., "gaussian".}

\item{zero}{A named logical vector indicating, which columns of
\code{x} should treat nonpositive values (zero or negative) as zero before
transformation. Must be the same length as the columns of \code{x}.}

\item{catzero}{A named list of binary indicator variables of length \code{ncol(x)}
for nonpositive values, created when specific variables are passed to the
\code{catzero} argument of \code{fit_mfp}. If an element of the list is
\code{NULL}, it indicates that the corresponding variable was not specified by
the user in the \code{catzero} argument of \code{fit_mfp}. Here, \code{catzero}
is a list of binary variables, not a named logical vector as in \code{fit_mfp}.}

\item{spike_decision}{Named vector indicating how spike-at-zero (SAZ)
variables are handled. Each element corresponds to a variable and encodes
the selected strategy: \code{1} = include FP for positive values plus binary SAZ,
\code{2} = treat as continuous FP only, \code{3} = include binary SAZ only.}

\item{acd_parameter}{Named list of ACD parameters produced by \code{fit_acd()},
with length equal to \code{ncol(x)}. Each list element corresponds to a variable;
if an element is \code{NULL}, the variable was not specified in the
\code{acdx} argument of \code{fit_mfp}.}

\item{prev_adj_params}{Named list storing adjustment variable transformations
from previous steps for each variable.}

\item{parallel}{Logical; if TRUE, perform computations in parallel using the
\code{foreach} package.}

\item{...}{Parameters passed to \code{fit_model()}.}
}
\value{
A list with two entries:
\itemize{
\item \code{powers}: FP power(s) of \code{xi} (or its ACD transformation) in fitted model.
\item \code{metrics}: A matrix with performance indices for fitted model.
\item \code{prev_adj_params}: Previously adjusted parameters.
}
}
\description{
"Linear" model here refers to a model that includes the variable
of interest \code{xi} with an FP (fractional polynomial) power of 1.
Note that \code{xi} may be ACD-transformed if indicated by \code{acdx[xi]}.
If the variable was passed through the \code{catzero} argument in \code{mfp2()},
both the continuous variable and its corresponding binary indicator
will be included in the model as linear terms.
For parameter definitions, see \code{find_best_fp_step}.
All parameters captured by \code{...} are passed to \code{fit_model}.
