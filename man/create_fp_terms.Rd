\arguments{
\item{fp_powers}{powers of the created FP terms.}

\item{acdx}{a logical vector of length nvars indicating which continuous
variables should undergo the approximate cumulative distribution (ACD)
transformation.}

\item{df}{a numeric vector of length nvars of degrees of freedom.}

\item{select}{a numeric vector of length nvars indicating significance levels
for backward elimination.}

\item{alpha}{a numeric vector of length nvars indicating significance levels
for tests between FP models of different degrees.}

\item{criterion}{a character string defining the criterion used to select
variables and FP models of different degrees.}

\item{zero}{A logical vector indicating, by position, which columns of
\code{x} should treat nonpositive values (zero or negative) as zero before
transformation. Must be the same length and in the same order as the columns
of \code{x}.}

\item{catzero}{A logical vector similar to \code{zero}, indicating which
columns of \code{x} should treat nonpositive values as zero and also have a binary
indicator automatically created and included in the model. Must match the length
and order of the columns in \code{x}. See \code{mfp2} for details.}

\item{spike}{A logical vector indicating which columns of \code{x} contain
a spike at zero. The length and order of \code{spike} must match those of
the columns in \code{x}.}

\item{spike_decision}{Integer vector indicating the modeling decision for
spike-at-zero variables.}
}
\value{
Dataframe with overview of all fp terms. Each row represents a variable,
with rownames giving the name of the variable. Variables with acd
transformation are prefixed by \code{A_} by the \code{print} and \code{summary} methods.
The dataframe comprises the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{df_initial}: initial degrees of freedom.
\item \code{select}: significance level used for backward elimination (or criterion name if not "pvalue").
\item \code{alpha}: significance level for FP terms (or criterion name if not "pvalue").
\item \code{acd}: logical, whether an ACD transformation was applied.
\item \code{zero}: logical, indicates whether only the positive values of the variable
are transformed (i.e., whether the FP function is applied exclusively to
values greater than zero).
\item \code{catzero}: logical, whether a binary variable for zero values was created.
\item \code{spike}: logical, indicates presence of a spike-at-zero variable.
\item \code{spike_decision}: integer code describing how the spike-at-zero variable is modeled.
\item \code{selected}: logical, whether the FP term is included in the final model.
\item \code{df_final}: final estimated degrees of freedom for the variable.
\item \verb{power1, power2, ...}: final estimated FP powers (as many columns as needed).
