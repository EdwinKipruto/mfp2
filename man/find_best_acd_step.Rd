\arguments{
\item{y}{The response variable}

\item{x}{a matrix of predictors. Each continuous predictor is assumed to have
been shifted and scaled.}

\item{xi}{name of the continuous predictor for which the FP function will be
estimated. There are no binary or two-level variables allowed.}

\item{allpowers}{a named list of FP powers of all variables, including
xi. Note that these powers are updated during backfitting or MFP cycles.}

\item{powers}{The set of allowed FP powers.}

\item{family}{A character name specifying the family name i.e. "gaussian",
"binomial", "poisson" or "cox"}

\item{method}{method for handling ties in cox model. see coxph() for explanation}

\item{weights}{see glm or coxph for explanation}

\item{offset}{see glm or coxph for explanation}

\item{acdx}{logical vector indicating the use of acd transformation.}
}
\description{
A function that fits 64 FP1 models for x and acd(x) and returns best
FP1(P1,P2) function and corresponding deviance.
