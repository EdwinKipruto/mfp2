\details{
The function selection procedure (FSP) is used if the p-value criterion is
chosen, whereas the criteria AIC and BIC select the model with the smallest
AIC and BIC, respectively.

It uses transformations for all other variables to assess the FP form of
the current variable of interest. This function covers three main use cases:
the linear case df = 1 to test between NULL and linear models; the case
that an acd transformation is requested for the variable of interest;
and the usual case of the normal mfp algorithm to assess non-linear
functional forms.
